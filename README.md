# Odin
Odin is a personal project for educational purposes. With it I intend to learn and practice the inner working of game development. The project won't be focused on organizing the software with a proper architecture, so don't expect a component based design or an intricate hierarchical structure using a lot of OOP paradigms. 

I will be developing on Windows using Visual Studio 2015, but I will try to keep the platform related code isolated on a platform layer so that most of the code will efectively be platform independent.

At first, I will be working on the rendering components using modern OpenGL. But probably in the future I will explore other areas like networking or AI.

You can see below, some images of the progress so far
